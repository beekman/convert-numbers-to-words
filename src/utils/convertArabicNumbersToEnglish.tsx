# Converting numbers to English words
As a super hip person who thinks numbers are passe, I want to create a tool that allows me to convert numbers formatted in Arabic numerals to the English word equivalent, e.g.:

1,572 => one thousand seventy two

I want to be able to do this for at least numbers from 0 (zero) through 1,000,000,000 (1 billion), and handle negative signs. AND! I want to be able to convert between numbers and words, so if I have a properly formatted word:

one million six hundred seventy five thousand four ->  1,675,004

const convertArabicNumbersToEnglish = (number) =>
	{
		if (number.length()=1) {
			switch 
		}
	}
